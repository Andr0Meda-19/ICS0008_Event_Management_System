# SPECIFICATION FOR A WEBSITE

## Overview

Problem: Users frequently encounter constraints when attempting to efficiently record and manage their notes due to limited functionalities.

Solution: Our project offers a straightforward solution by allowing users to seamlessly create, view, and delete notes, providing a minimalist yet effective approach to note-taking and management.

### Objective

We gonna make a system to suit our own convenience, so that we might not use our brains in the future.

### Goals

* Design and Structure        27 February
* server-side scripting       26 March
* Data and UI interactions    23 April
* Complete Project            01 May

### Phases

Same as YOUR COURSE (`ICS0008`) milestones.

### Site map

Provide a hierarchical structure of your website as a `tree` (can be an image):

```
  +--Add Event
  +--Event List
  +--About US
  +--Log in/Sign Up
      +--Terms & Conditions
```

### Content Types

Describe what kind of data types each page contains:

* new?
* blogs?
* images?
* people?
* products?
* comments?
* etc

Are these data types hierarchical? etc.

### Page Templates

Before the first milestone you should have "page templates", i.e., HTML pages that illustrate what info and data each page will contain. You can use mock content.

Make sure you include navigation menus, etc.

## Design

The page templates should come with CSS to give a good idea what the pages will look like when all components (`PHP`, `SQL` and `JavaScript`) are added.

## Functionality

How does your website work? What are the specific parts that each of your page require?

* What fields are required for sign-up?
* What happens if user leaves a comment?
* What are the user roles?
* What are performance requirements?

## Browser Support

* Chrome/Chromium
* Firefox 

## Hosting

ENOS.
